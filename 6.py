#This is your first Python Subscription
# After each step save your script as "6.py" and run it in a virtual environment
# 1. Create a list with the following values in this order
#    - cats
#    - dogs
#    - 17
#    - [1,2,3]
# 2. Use a for loop to print the contents of the list
# 3. Create a variable that is set to 17
# 4. Use if/elif/else to determine if the number is > 20, >10 or 10 or less
# 5. Print to the screen what range the number falls within
# 6. change the variable to a number greater than 20 and make sure it works
# 7. Use a while loop to go thru and print the contents of you list, make the index number the counter
# Good Luck
