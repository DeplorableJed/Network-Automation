#This is your first Python Subscription
# After each step save your script as "6.py" and run it in a virtual environment
# 1. Import the datetime packate
# 2. define a function called print_time
#    - as part of the function print "task completed"
#    - still under the function use the following command *print(datetime.datetime.now())*
#    - still under the function print a blank line
# 6. Create a for loop that goes thru a range from 0-10
# 7. Call the function at the end to print the current time to the screen
# Good Luck
